LeadLabs gives you control over which signals are displayed in your account. By customizing your **Insights Preferences**, you can focus only on the data that matters most to your sales process, while avoiding clutter from irrelevant signals.

## Understanding Signal Buckets

Inside Insights Preferences, signals are organized into categories (buckets), such as:

- **Personal Overview**
- **Self-Authored Content**
- **Engaged Content**
- **Account**
- **Overview Account**
- **Insights Account**
- **User**
- **Custom Signals**

## Customizing Signals

You can toggle individual signals on or off, depending on your needs.

**Example:**\
If your business doesn’t require **likes, dislikes, or interests**, simply turn them off. Once disabled, these signals will no longer appear in your instance.

## Applying Changes

- After updating your preferences, close the pop-up.
- Click **Insights** again to reload your view.
- Perform a **hard refresh** of the page to apply changes.
- The disabled signals (e.g., likes, dislikes, interests) will no longer be visible.
