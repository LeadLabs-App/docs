## What Are Personas?

In LeadLabs, **Personas** represent the different types of individuals you interact with during outreach or middle-of-the-funnel activities.

- **Below the line Personas** → Users or influencers of your product.
- **Above the line Personas** → Key decision-makers for your product.

During calibration, LeadLabs automatically generates **six default Personas**: three above the line and three below the line.

## Creating New Personas

If you sell to more than six types of buyers, you can easily add more Personas.

1. Click **Create Persona**.
2. Choose between:
   - **Manual creation** → Enter details yourself.
   - **Generate using AI (recommended)** → Let LeadLabs AI build Personas for you.

### Using AI to Generate Personas
