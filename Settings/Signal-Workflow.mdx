LeadLabs allows you to extend its capabilities by creating **custom signal workflows**. These workflows help you capture and monitor signals that aren’t automatically included in the platform, giving you more flexibility and control over your outreach and sales strategies.

## Accessing Signal Workflows

1. Click **View Insights** on any profile.
2. Navigate to the **Settings tab** (the fifth icon in the menu bar).
3. Select **Workflows** from the options.

## Creating a Signal Workflow

1. Click **Create Workflow**.
2. Give your workflow a name (e.g., _Compliance Checker_).
3. Write the logic for the signal you want to monitor.
   - Example: "\_Create a workflow to check a company’s \_**_compliance status_**", which isn’t captured by default.

---

## Activating a Workflow

- After creation, the workflow is **inactive by default**.
- Toggle it **on** to activate.
- Once active, the workflow will automatically run every time you visit a profile and appear under the **"Account Insights"** Tab in the first menu item.

---

## Example: Compliance Checker Workflow

- Create a new workflow named **Compliance Checker**.
- Once activated, LeadLabs automatically checks and displays compliance status when you visit a company profile.
- This eliminates manual checks and surfaces critical information in real time.

---

## Benefits of Signal Workflows

- **Custom tracking**: Add signals not included by default.
- **Automation**: Workflows run automatically on every profile visit.
- **Flexibility**: Build workflows tailored to your business needs.
- **Real-time insights**: Instantly access signals like compliance status, hiring activity, or any other custom criteria.
