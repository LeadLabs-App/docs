### Step 1: Open Your Prospect’s Profile

Visit your prospect’s LinkedIn profile and click the **comment button**. This takes you to the section of their profile where all recent posts are displayed.

---

### Step 2: Browse Recent Posts

Scroll left or right to load more posts and choose the one you’d like to engage with—ideally the most recent, for maximum visibility and relevance.

---

### Step 3: Choose Comment Type

Once you’ve selected a post, decide the style of comment you’d like to leave:

- **Supportive**: To validate and encourage their perspective.
- **Contradictory**: To respectfully challenge their point of view and spark dialogue.

---

### Step 4: Select a Tone

After picking the type, refine your comment further by setting the tone. LeadLabs gives you multiple options:

- **Neutral**: A balanced, professional response.
- **Insightful**: Adds perspective, analysis, or expertise.
- **Formal**: Maintains a polished, professional tone suitable for executive-level engagement.

LeadLabs will instantly generate a **starter comment** based on your selections.

### Step 5: Refresh if Needed

If the first suggestion doesn’t fit your voice, click the **refresh button**. You can generate as many variations as you like until you find the one that works.

---

### Step 6: Copy and Paste

Once you’re happy with the comment:

1. Click **copy text**.
2. Go back to the LinkedIn post you selected.
3. Paste the comment and make any final edits to personalize it.

---

### Step 7: Post and Engage

When your comment feels ready, post it. You’ve now left a thoughtful contribution that strengthens your presence and helps you connect meaningfully with your prospect.
