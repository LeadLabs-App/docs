The **Canvas Genie** feature in LeadLabs allows you to quickly create new canvases using simple natural language. Instead of writing complex prompts or juggling multiple tools, you can describe what you need in one or two lines, and Canvas Genie will handle the rest.

## 1. Navigating to the Canvas Library

1. Go to any **profile** (your own or a prospect’s).
2. Click the **Insights** page and allow LeadLabs to load the initial data.
3. Select the **Canvas** tab (the fourth menu bar option).

## 2. Creating a New Canvas

- Click the **Create Canvas** button.
- You have two options:
  - **Use Canvas Genie** (recommended): Describe what you want in simple natural language, and LeadLabs will create a first draft canvas using its built-in intelligence.
  - **Start from scratch**: Skip Canvas Genie and manually build a canvas (best if you’re already skilled at writing prompts).

<Tip>
  While using Canvas Genie, specify as many details as possible (even if it's unstructured or raw) so that our Genie can create the best canvas for your needs.
</Tip>

## 3. How Canvas Genie Works

When you use Canvas Genie:

- Enter a short description of your workflow (See e.g., _“Spiced Discovery Framework”_ or \_“Video Script for LinkedIn” \_as shown).
- LeadLabs expands this into a detailed blueprint.
- It automatically selects the best AI models for different tasks (e.g., Perplexity for research, Claude for frameworks, GPT for writing).
- The process takes about **30–60 seconds** while LeadLabs pulls in your business goals, variables, and context.
- Once complete, you’ll have a fully generated first draft of your canvas.

## 4. Editing and Refining Your Canvas

- **Rewrite Prompts**: If a generated prompt isn’t what you want, click **Rewrite**, type your change in natural language, and LeadLabs will instantly update it.
- **Change Models**: If needed, select a different AI model from the dropdown. Each model includes a short description of its specialty to help you choose.
- **Add Variables**: Click **Add** to include dynamic variables such as _prospect name_. These variables will auto-populate in your workflow, keeping canvases flexible and scalable.
